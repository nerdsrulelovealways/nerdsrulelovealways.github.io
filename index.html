    <p>I'm feeling a disconnect here with what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I missed the first part of the assignment. I'm not sure what I am supposed to be recording while I attempt to figure this out. I have figured out many things in my life. This is still feeling like I am missing something. </p>
